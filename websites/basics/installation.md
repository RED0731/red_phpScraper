# Installation

The library is usually installed using composer:

```bash
composer require spekulatius/phpscraper
```

## Usage

After the installation is completed the package will be picked up by the Composer autoloader. If you are using a VanillaPHP library you will need to include the autoloader in your script:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

If you are using a framework such as Laravel, SilverStripe or Flarum, you won't need this step.
